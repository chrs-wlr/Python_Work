#Display Knowledge is Power on one line.
print("Knowledge is Power") 

#Display Knowledge is Power on three lines centered:
print("\nKnowledge")#I decided to use \n because it seperated it from the first print
print("   is    ")#I was going to use \t with this but i noticed spaces looked cleaner and more like the ref in the doc
print("  Power  ")


#Display Knowledge is Power within a box
print("\n======================")#What I said on line 11
print("| Knowledge is Power |") #i used the last assignment "Box.py" to help me write this
print("======================")
