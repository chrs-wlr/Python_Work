#Display Knowledge is Power on one line.
print("Knowledge is Power") 

#Display Knowledge is Power on three lines centered:
print("\nKnowledge")# I decided to use \n because it seperated it from the first print
print("   is    ")# I was going to use \t with this but i noticed spaces looked cleaner and more like the ref in the doc
print("  Power  ")


#Display Knowledge is Power within a box
print("\n======================")# My comment on line 10
print("| Knowledge is Power |") # I used the last assignment "Box.py" to help me write this
print("======================")
